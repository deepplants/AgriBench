      "Many years ago, I was the chief guest at a function. This was held in a hostel for poor students that had been built by a philanthropist. Food and shelter were free, but students had to bear other expenses like tuition and clothing.\n",
      "In my younger days. I have come across many families who would look after students who were economically backward but otherwise bright. They used to help them with their fees or clothing and often with their food as well. In those days most colleges were located in larger towns. Many poor students who came to study in these towns used to stay with these families and would be treated as part of the family. The women of the house considered this a good deed and helped the poor students wholeheartedly. Today the situation is different. Even smaller towns have schools and colleges, so this custom has disappeared.\n",
      "While I was sitting on the dais, I remembered the past and congratulated the person who had built the hostel. It was a good deed and of great help to many students. The hostel secretary told me about some of the students in the hostel who had secured ranks but had a problem paying their tuition fees.\n",
      "He said “Madam, this year we have three students from different disciplines who have secured ranks. All of them are from extremely poor families. They have one more year to complete their degree. “What are they studying? One is medicine, the second in engineering and third in commerce” Can I meet them after the function?\n",
      "The function went on as usual. Often, at such functions, too much praise is lavished on the chief guest. Sometimes, they even make exaggerated and false claims about the chief guest.I feel this unnecessary praising is the highest form of corruption, where people are easily fooled, and it encourages those who are praised to develop an inflated opinion of themselves. That’s why in the twelfth century, in Karnataka the great revolutionary leader Basaveshwara warned in his teaching that praise is like a golden gallows. After the function,I met the three poor bright boys whom the secretary had told me about. They were a little puzzled, shy and nervous. All of them had the same story. Father in a small job unable to make ends meet, large families back in the village, no land or any other assets. Only sheer determination to excel in studies had brought them here against all odds.\n",
