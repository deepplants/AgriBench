Most commonly found on apple it can also be found on lime (Tilia spp.) and poplar (Populus spp.). Widely used as a Christmas decoration, the use of mistletoe was recorded by Pliny the Elder who described the significance of mistletoe on oaks to Druids. The Tree Council along with the University of Oxford and Fera Science are looking for participants for a citizen science survey to determine how abundant mistletoe is, and where it grows.

Such symptoms are widespread in the tropics, though whether you consider this plant diseased is another matter. Comments on the other options: Yes, it could be a virus , but Id expect to see less vigorous growth and perhaps death of leaves. You could argue that this is a varietal characteristic: this is what people are used to seeing and the plant is growing vigorously. Poinsettias are infected by a phytoplasma and sold on their compact shape. Definitely not insect feeding. Ari was smiling because I saw an infected plant and he saw normal growth.",

The incorrect answers were: Physiological problem This is what I think is causing the problem (although it is very strange as the plants either side are unaffected). Plants, usually fruits, can split open if they take up water too quickly. It may superficially look like insect damage or pathogen infection, but the wound is generally clean. Phytoplasma infection Phytoplasma infection can cause gross morphological changes to the development of a plant. There is no evidence that this symptom is due to a phytoplasma but this is the kind of symptom they can provoke. Animal damage It looks like a large animal has laid on the plant and snapped the leaf blade at the point of attachment to the petiole.  There is no sign of any infection at the site of breakage.",

This tip dieback of the leaf is characteristic of nitrogen deficiency in maize but not in other crops. The general yellowing of the lower leaves is a more general symptom . The incorrect answers were Potassium: in the case of potassium (K) shortage it is the outsides of the leaves that are the first to show symptoms. Sulphur: as sulphur is not a major nutrient, the symptoms are seen in the upper leaves first. The symptoms of sulphur deficiency is a general yellowing of the whole leaf. Phosphate: shortage of phosphate (P) induces a reddening of the lower regions of the plant.",

If an irrigation system provides all the water for a crop and the water has the slightest mineral content, salts will build up over time on the surface of the soil. When installing an irrigation system, it is often necessary to install drainage too so that the soil could be flushed through occasionally. The incorrect answers were: Fungal mycelium growing due to the excessive moisture ; this only occasionally happens in extremely humid conditions, not where an irrigation system is necessary. Bleaching of the humus from the normal brown to white ; even in the strongest sun, light does not bleach soil. Fine root hairs searching for water on the very surface of the soil ; root hairs extend only one millimetre from the root at most and will never grow to the surface.",

The uptake of water seems to be the issue. The incorrect answers were: Insect feeding Sap feeding insects do not often cause feeding marks, but when they do, they are often necrotic. Fungal infection Rust fungi can sometimes cause a slight blister before they burst the surface, but they would never get this large, nor so uniform. Mineral deficiency There are occasional unusual symptoms caused by a lack of nutrients (blossom end rot is a good example) but this is not one of them.",

        "explanation": "The correct answer is: Insect galls: This is the larval stage of the mango gall midge. Larvae penetrate plant tissues and live in flattened, blister-like galls. Final-instar larvae emerge from damaged tissues and fall to the soil where they pupate. When conditions are favourable a new generation of adults emerges within 4-6 days, but when conditions are unfavourable the full-grown larvae construct silk cocoons in which they rest for one or more years before emerging. The incorrect answers were: Frass: this would be very unusual frass. The frass from caterpillars is large and black like this but is never stuck to (or embedded into) leaf tissue . Thrips frass can be stuck to the leaves like this but is never this large. Bacterial galls: it is unusual to see bacterial galls on a leaf but the three things which indicate that these are not bacterial galls is the fact that there is so many of them, they are all approximately the same size and that they are smooth. Anthracnose : this is a fungal disease that causes extensive leaf spots and death of the leaves and not the small smooth disc-shaped galls we see here .",

It is extremely unlikely (but not unknown) that a pathogen would reduce the impact of a weed population in an agricultural setting. You are better off to remove all weeds. NB. Pathogens are used very successfully in classical biological control . The incorrect answers were: Leave the infected weeds so that the disease could spread : the disease may spread from the infected weeds to uninfected weeds but the competition from the original weeds would be too great to justify this plan. The removal of the weed depends on the potential for the disease to spread to the crop: some diseases can spread from weeds to crops but see the answer above. Leave all the weeds so that the disease can spread to healthy weeds: it would be foolhardy to leave all the weeds thinking that the pathogen would take care of them.",

The incorrect answers were: The dilution of the chemical is unimportant provided the correct amount of active ingredient is applied. This is true to a point, but once the spray becomes too dilute, the spray will run off leaves and onto the soil. The dilution of the chemical has to be very exact to ensure best results. The dilution of chemical does not always have to be exact and, usually, there is some sort of flexibility in the range of dilutions possible. The more concentrated the solution the better and dilution is done only to make the concentrate go further. A more concentrated fungicide will generally have greater capacity to kill the fungus, but it would be un-economic, illegal and would scorch the crop.",

The gardener was clearly spraying off the weeds at the edge of the bed and has just caught the potato plants with the spray. This low dose of glyphosate has produced symptoms at the top of the plant. The young leaves are turning yellow, spreading up from the base of the leaf, but notice that the distal ends of these leaves remain green; these symptoms are typical of sub-lethal glyphosate exposure. The incorrect answers were: Iron deficiency The yellowing of younger leaves is typical of iron deficiency, but, characteristically, if iron shortage is the cause, the leaf veins remain green. Iron deficiency does not induce a wilt . Phytoplasma infection Yellowing is a common symptom of phytoplasma infection, but they very rarely cause wilts. Fungal infection In the absence of yellowing grass and weeds nearby, this would be a sensible suggestion, although other factors could have caused these symptoms.",

        "explanation": "The correct answer is: Wind damage. There are probably other factors which contribute to a temporary response to localised water loss. Ive often seen it early in the morning, disappearing later in the day. Comments on the other options: Mite feeding causes leaf browning and the plant becomes ragged. Both viruses affect the lamina of the leaf, with changes in colour and reduced growth. When leaf curling affects an otherwise an unmarked leaf then start to suspect a non- pest cause. Check if leaves have been affected at the same time (as seen here), suggesting a sudden change and upset to growth, such as frost or herbicide damage. Diseases develop progressively.",

It you look past the colour you can see that the tuber is perfectly fine. Nutrient deficiency Phosphate deficiency will often cause the lower leaves to become reddened (as per question 1) but this does not extend to the tubers. Water mould infection The only water mould that will infect the tubers of potatoes is Phytophthora.  This is definitely not Phytophthora infection; the tissue would be wet and brown, not hard and purple.  ",

Many things may cause the tips of leaves to die back like this, but the tan colour of the dead region and extreme transition between the dead and healthy tissue indicates scorch.  In this case, the scorch is due to ammonium nitrate solution having been applied when the sun was too strong. The incorrect answers were: Nutrient deficiency : much yellowing occurs. The sharp transition from healthy to dead tissue is not typical of nutrient deficiencies. Insect larvae within the stem: Insect larvae can cause problems in wheat but the symptoms are a general withering of the plant and not the sharp transition between healthy and dead tissue . Bacterial infection: Bacterial infection generally appears wet and, whereas the dead areas here appear very dry, you would rarely see such a marked transition between healthy and dead tissue .",

The sudden wilting of the canopy is linked to the ultimate collapse and failure of conducting vessels ( phloem ). Comments on the other options: Rhinoceros beetle is also damaging but crowns tend to become ragged and lack this sudden collapse of fronds. Waterlogging would affect more palm trees at the same time. Fungal root rot is a good guess, and Phytophthora is widespread. Difficult to distinguish without testing of samples.",

The incorrect answers were: Insect feeding: rarely causes necrosis most sucking insects leave no mark on the leaves. Water mould: they sporulate as, either: 1) microscopic hard oospores that cannot be seen, as they are too tiny and are deep within the tissue , or 2) as fluffy growth, usually on the underside of leaves.

To test for a downy mildew , put a symptomatic leaf in a plastic bag overnight in the dark and look for sporulation in the morning. The incorrect answers were: High temperature, high light: the downy mildews do not thrive in such conditions and the infected areas often turn necrotic and die. Low temperature; low light: under these conditions it is likely that sporulation will occur due to the concurrent increase in relative humidity but it is the humidity that is the important factor.

The difference between unhealthy and normal growth is stark and dramatic  a good starting point for thinking  phytoplasma  Comments on the other options: Yes, its similar to herbicide damage  but drift is unlikely to reach the top parts of the crown. Virus infection is also a possibility; distinguishing little leaves from reduced growth is not easy and requires close examination (even then Im easily confused).",

The incorrect answers were: Nematodes attacking the roots; nematodes can cause stunting and yellowing of plants but attack is never uniform as seen here, nor in a straight line. Variation in soil type ; the soil can have a significant effect on crop growth and variation between soils can be dramatic, but they are never in a completely straight line.

Nodules are always displaced to the side of the root, whereas galls usually appear to be part of the root. The incorrect answers were: They are not intensely coloured Both galls and nodules are generally whitish. Galls may be creamy coloured and nodules may have a slight pink colour. They are less than 4mm across Nodules are always less than 4mm across, but galls can vary in size from a few millimetres to up to 15 mm and larger. They are round in cross section.

Nutrient deficiency: is a common cause for plants to turn yellow but compare the plants at the edge of the field which appear to have no symptoms. It is unlikely that there would be this much variation in the soil over such small distances.

        "explanation": "The correct answer is: Petals add nutrients to the leaf surface and can assist infection by opportunistic pathogens. The leaf surface can be a hostile environment for fungal pathogens, but the additional nutrients provided by the petals can provide a stimulus to allow infection. The incorrect answers were: Once the petals have fallen, the developing fruit is extremely exposed to pathogen attack. This may occur to some extent, but the presence of the petals does not really protect the ovaries. Petal fall is a good mid-point in the growth of a plant to put on a spray. This may be the case, but crop protection should not be about calendar spraying. The fall of petals has no bearing on fungicide application. This is not the case, see above.",

        "explanation": "The correct answer is: It is extremely important as it provides the sugars to fill the grain In wheat, the flag leaf is the most important one to keep free of diseases. If only one fungicide spray is applied to a wheat crop, it is best to do it when the flag leaf has just emerged. This is not the case in other cereals where the flag leaf may play a relatively minor role (e.g. barley). The incorrect answers were: The flag leaf is unimportant as the ear has already formed by the time it emerges. It is true that the ear has formed but there is no grain in the ear. The flag leaf will shade the ear and actually reduces yield. The ear itself does contribute to grain fill to an extent and there will be some shading, but that is insignificant and you want the flag leaf to be in full sun. It is just as important as any other leaf. With regard to grain fill, the importance of the leaves falls off rapidly as you descend the plant.",

In some pathogens (such as P.infestans which causes late blight of potato or tomato) oospores will only form if there are   and  strains present. Many countries only have one of the two mating types , thus preventing sexual spores being produced. The incorrect answers were: It is good to keep the amount of pathogen low in whatever way you can; whilst this is true, the amount of additional pathogen arriving on imports would be miniscule relative to the established population. It will allow imports to be excluded so that local farmers can be supported; under WTO rules it is not easy to exclude produce except for phytosanitary reasons, but this is not the reason from a plant pathology viewpoint. The identification of the pathogen may not have been accurate and another pathogen may gain access to the country; this is unlikely as phytosanitary inspectors are well trained and are supported by expert scientists who test potential new pathogens found on imported material.

The symptoms of phosphate deficiency, like the other major nutrients (nitrogen and potassium), are always seen in the lower leaves first. This reddening is due to stress; caused by a stem borer living in the stem at the point where the plant turns red.  Note that the other plants around are not showing any reddening. The incorrect answers were: The leaves are the wrong shade of red. The red colour develops due to stress and the diagnosis on the hue of the colour is not really possible. The plant is not stunted.

In nature, the bacteria are exclusively transmitted by insects from the Cicadellidae and Ceropidae families, which feed on plants xylem fluid. There are several species of insects in the UK which could act as vectors (agents of spread) of X. fastidiosa bacteria, including the common froghopper ( Philaenus spumarius ). Although such insects usually only fly short distances of up to 100 metres, they can be carried much longer distances by the wind. IMAGE: David Cappaert, Bugwood.org",

Comments on the other options: Genetic abnormality might appear an attractive option yet these are distinctive symptoms with a scattered appearance, more indicative of a precise cause. Insects and mites are common gall -formers on leaves and fleshy tissue  not on woody stems. Yes, there is a fungal canker on ash ( Neonectria ditissima ), which kills tissue rather than stimulating new growth, as seen here. P. savastanoi is an unusual and relatively unknown pathogen , yet widespread and damaging on olive trees (related to ash).",

The incorrect answers were: Bacterial pathogens: commonly cause leaf spots such as this but they never produce structures that can be seen (even with a hand lens). Water moulds: include the downy mildews and Phytophthora; neither produce structures such as these. They both generally produce a downy growth on the underside of the leaf (in the case of Phytophthora with a lot of necrosis (browning)).

        "explanation": "The correct answer is: All of the above Conspicuous and often numerous sunken, bright orange-brown cankers can occur on the bark of young branches of infected trees. The cankers caused by chestnut blight can eventually girdle branches and stems, with all live tissue above the canker dying. On grafted trees, infections are most frequently found in areas close to the graft where callusing occurs, whereas in orchard and coppiced trees infections usually occur at the base of the stem (collars or insertion points). Masses of pin-head sized, yellow-orange to reddish-brown pustules may also be evident on infected bark. These fruiting bodies erupt through lenticels (gas exchange structures) in the bark and exude long, yellow-orange tendrils/threads of spores in humid and wet weather. Another obvious symptom of this disease is wilted and brown dying and dead leaves which are retained by the tree above a girdling canker . Below the canker , epicormic growth (prolific sprouting) may be visible.",

Frequently seen in some years on isolated or small groups of trees. Comments on the other options: The large area with dying leaves suggests that a major branch has been damaged below. Wilt pathogens result in a more uneven pattern of leaf death; and I dont know of any such pathogens affecting sycamore, or Acer species in the UK. The tree was too far from the sea to be affected by salt damage, and the pattern of damage would have been less severe and more diffuse.",

No. Some viruses may be passed on into seed, but this is relatively unusual.

Whilst farmers are generally familiar with the asexual spore production on crop plants, they are less familiar with the sexual phase of the same fungus which often takes place on an unrelated plant. It is this other plant that is termed the alternate host . The incorrect answers were: Any wild plant that is susceptible to a pathogen : this is not considered an alternate host ; it is just part of the host range of the fungus. A crop plant that is slightly susceptible to a pathogen , but not as badly as another crop: this is not considered an alternate host ; it is just part of the host range of the fungus. A plant that the pathogen will survive on when the crop is not in production: it is often the case that the alternate host allows the fungus to over-winter when the crop is not in production, but that is not what makes it an alternate host .",

The incorrect answers were: Definitely indicates a deficiency of phosphate This is a common symptom of P deficiency but is not the only cause of reddening.

Infection causing the black sooty spores on the cobs are a much more familiar sight. The incorrect answers were: Crown gall caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ; crown gall can produce galls of this size but the galls are never smooth they are usually brown and Agrobacterium does not infect grasses. Gall -forming insect; this is reasonable suggestion but (difficult to tell from the photo) the leaf is distorted and there are no galls there . Viral infection; the distortion seen here would not be so localised if it was caused by a virus .",

        "explanation": "The correct answer is: The decision as to what to do will depend on the crop and pest : Generally, it is appropriate to destroy the crop trash after harvest (ploughing or composting or burning), however there are times when it may be appropriate to remove it and store it.  If the pest is not mobile; the natural enemies are mobile and there is no threat from other pests or diseases, then this may be a sensible strategy. The incorrect answers were: Burn it or compost it as far as is practical; this is a safe option and is usually the correct one. Store the debris nearby to allow the natural enemies to emerge; this can be a good practice but should not be universally adopted unless you are aware of all the pests and diseases on the trash. Take it to a field where the same crop is being grown and spread it onto the soil; this is never appropriate and would completely undermine most of the benefits of crop rotation.",

Separate the wispy dieback (fungal) around the crown periphery from the larger dead branches I associate with root disturbance and other abiotic factors. Described as stag-headed because they look like antlers. Comments on the other options: Air pollution is one of those fall-back options: when pest and disease options have been ostensibly eliminated look for something that could have a widespread impact on tree growth. Nutrient deficiencies is another fall-back option. Ive not included lightning damage. I said diagnosing tree health problems wasnt going to be easy ...",
