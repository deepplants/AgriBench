# 🌾 Agribench: A Domain-Specific Benchmark for Large Language Models in Agriculture 🌱

Agribench is a specialized benchmark 📊 designed to evaluate and improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) 🧠 in the agricultural domain 🌍. It focuses on understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in tasks specific to agronomy, farming 🚜, and related disciplines.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📚 Domain-Specific Datasets**:
  - 🌾 *500 Perguntas 500 Respostas (EMBRAPA)*: An open-ended Q&A dataset from the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation.
  - 🌱 *Certified Crop Adviser (CCA) Exam*: Multiple-choice questions to assess agricultural competency.
  - 🍃 *AgriExam*: Multiple-choice questions focusing on Indian agriculture.
  - 🖼️ *GBIF*: Global dataset for identifying species from images, useful for biodiversity and crop management.
  - 🐞 *EPPO*: European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization database, used for image-based identification of pests, diseases, and plants.


- **📏 Metrics**:
  - 📝 Focus on prompt-based evaluations for open-ended questions.
  - 📈 Advanced evaluation metrics to assess model performance on complex tasks.

- **🔧 Methods**:
  - 🔍 *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)*: Incorporating external knowledge bases like GBIF, EPPO, and AGROVOC for information retrieval.
  - 🔄 *Ensemble Refinement*: Enhancing model predictions through multiple model outputs.

## 🎯 Goals

1. **🏗️ Reproduce Existing Benchmarks**: 
   - Replicating Microsoft's agronomy benchmark.

2. **🌍 Expand Dataset Variety**:
   - Include structured datasets from recognized agricultural sources (e.g., USDA, EPPO).

3. **🧠 Increase Task Complexity**:
   - Introduce more challenging language tasks involving reasoning, planning 📝, and multimodal inputs (e.g., images 📷, videos 🎥).

4. **🚀 Improve Model Adaptation**:
   - Develop retrieval systems and refine models for better real-world application in agriculture.

## 🚜 Applications
- 🌱 Enhancing virtual assistant capabilities for farmers and agronomists.
- 🌾 Providing accurate guidance on agricultural procedures like crop management, pest control 🐛, and farming techniques 🌿.

🎉 Contributions are welcome to help improve LLMs' performance in agricultural problem-solving and decision-making!
