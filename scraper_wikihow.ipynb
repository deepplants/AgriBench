      "3. **Select suitable branches**: Opt for straight, sturdy branches with a diameter between 1/4 inch (6 mm) and 1-1/2 inches (38 mm).\n",
      "4. **Cut from lower shoots**: Collect scion wood from the lower part of the tree to avoid weak or spindly growth.\n",
      "5. **Make clean cuts**: Cut the branch at an angle using a sharp, sterile knife or pruning tool, making sure each cut is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above a bud eye or lateral bud.\n",
      "6. **Remove leaves and twigs**: Gently remove all leaves and twigs from the scion wood to prevent moisture loss and promote healing during the grafting process.\n",
