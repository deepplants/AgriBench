Generally, the plant self-regulates the ideal number of pods and grains it can have, basically based on the availability of nutrients and, mainly, the availability of carbohydrates.

       "   'answer': 'In terms of seed production, weed species can produce hundreds or thousands of seeds from a single plant, whereas a cowpea plant produces only a few dozen. Once formed and released from the mother plant, weed seeds have the ability to remain alive (viable) in the soil for a long time, sometimes for years, without germinating and forming new plants, even when environmental conditions are unfavorable. This characteristic is known as dormancy, which is a survival strategy of weed species. In contrast, cowpea seeds lose viability quickly and, once sown, will germinate and form a new plant. If any environmental stress occurs, such',\n",

       "   'answer': 'Salinity represents the amount of salts in the irrigation water. It is expressed by the electrical conductivity (EC) of the water. In general, the cowpea culture tolerates EC of the water up to 3.3 dS m^-1, without a reduction in grain productivity. This limit varies according to the cowpea variety.',\n",

       "   'answer': 'As aphids feed by sucking the affected parts and also inject toxins into the plants, causing a typical thickening of the leaves, i.e., their edges turn downwards and there is a slight deformation of the shoots. In addition, they live in colonies, which are easily identified. Since they feed exclusively on sap, these insects eliminate a large amount of a sweet liquid, from which ants feed, which, in turn, protect them from natural enemies. In addition, this sweet substance also serves as a substrate for the growth, on the leaves, of a black mold, called fumagina. The combination of these signs allows for easy identification in the field of aph',\n",
