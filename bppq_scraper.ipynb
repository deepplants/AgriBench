Originally recorded in North America, there were old records of its presence in Europe (outside Denmark and Norway), although not causing severe symptoms. Although known to be present in the UK, reports have increased since 2015. Tree deaths have often occurred on fir species in landscape plantings, Christmas tree plantations, and forest stands.',\n",

When conditions are favourable a new generation of adults emerges within 4-6 days, but when conditions are unfavourable the full-grown larvae construct silk cocoons in which they rest for one or more years before emerging.

Thrips frass can be stuck to the leaves like this but is never this large. Bacterial galls: it is unusual to see bacterial galls on a leaf but the three things which indicate that these are not bacterial galls is the fact that there is so many of them, they are all approximately the same size and that they are smooth.

Ive often seen it early in the morning, disappearing later in the day. Comments on the other options: Mite feeding causes leaf browning and the plant becomes ragged. Both viruses affect the lamina of the leaf, with changes in colour and reduced growth. When leaf curling affects an otherwise an unmarked leaf then start to suspect a non- pest cause. Check if leaves have been affected at the same time (as seen here), suggesting a sudden change and upset to growth, such as frost or herbicide damage. Diseases develop progressively.',\n",

Many things may cause the tips of leaves to die back like this, but the tan colour of the dead region and extreme transition between the dead and healthy tissue indicates scorch.  In this case, the scorch is due to ammonium nitrate solution having been applied when the sun was too strong. The incorrect answers were: Nutrient deficiency : much yellowing occurs. The sharp transition from healthy to dead tissue is not typical of nutrient deficiencies. Insect larvae within the stem: Insect larvae can cause problems in wheat but the symptoms are a general withering of the plant and not the sharp transition between healthy and dead tissue . Bacterial infection: Bacterial infection generally appears wet and, whereas the dead areas here appear very dry, you would rarely see such a marked transition between healthy and dead tissue .',\n",

They are attached to roots just like nematode galls, but, unlike a gall , they are not made up of the plant tissue ; this is the swollen body of the female nematode , packed full of eggs. The incorrect answers were: Galls: these are commonly associated with nematode infection (but not all nematodes cause galls). Cysts are much smaller than galls and are always of extremely similar size and appear clean, despite being in the soil. Eggs: difficult to imagine what animal would have laid eggs in this haphazard way, most insects / animals will lay eggs bunched tightly together.

Tomato spotted wilt virus The symptoms of TSWV are mostly ringspots and rarely a wilt . Viruses never produce structures visible to the naked eye.',\n",

The darkness is pretty well guaranteed at night unless the leaves are in experimental conditions. High humidity often occurs when there has been rainfall and then the temperature drops. To test for a downy mildew , put a symptomatic leaf in a plastic bag overnight in the dark and look for sporulation in the morning. The incorrect answers were: High temperature, high light: the downy mildews do not thrive in such conditions and the infected areas often turn necrotic and die. Low temperature; low light: under these conditions it is likely that sporulation will occur due to the concurrent increase in relative humidity but it is the humidity that is the important factor. When free water has splashed up onto the underside of the leaf: the downy mildews will not sporulate into free water, the leaf must be dry.',\n",

Necrotroph is the opposite of a biotroph; a necrotrophic pathogen will use an arsenal of toxins and enzymes to overpower the hosts defences and kill the tissue ahead of the advancing fungal mycelium . The incorrect answers were: It describes the fungal group that the pathogen is in; the fact that the fungus is a necrotroph has no bearing on the classification (for example genus /species) of the pathogen . It means that the pathogen will only grow on material that has died previously; fungi that grow on dead material are generally described as saprobes or saprophytes.  They are generally not pathogens but are opportunistic / imposter pathogens. It means that the pathogen will rot the host plant ; almost all necrotrophs do rot the host tissue , as it is often killed with host cell wall degrading enzymes, but that is not what the term means.',\n",

       "  'explanation': 'The correct answer is: They take up a lot of room and will crowd out the crop. The main problem with wild oats among the crop is that; they are extremely large plants that grow very quickly, will shade the crop and remove water and nutrients from the soil. They also produce thousands of seeds which can be dormant, making them a very difficult weed to control. The incorrect answers were: The seeds contaminate the harvest, reducing its quality. Unless the harvest is being saved for seed, this is not a problem. They carry diseases over season to season, making crop rotation redundant. This may be true to a limited extent, but is not foremost in farmers minds when they are battling wild oats. The seeds are shed before the combine harvests the crop and do not contribute to the yield. This is usually true, but it is not the missing yield that is the problem.',\n",

This is not the case in other cereals where the flag leaf may play a relatively minor role (e.g. barley). The incorrect answers were: The flag leaf is unimportant as the ear has already formed by the time it emerges. It is true that the ear has formed but there is no grain in the ear. The flag leaf will shade the ear and actually reduces yield. The ear itself does contribute to grain fill to an extent and there will be some shading, but that is insignificant and you want the flag leaf to be in full sun.

       "  'explanation': 'The correct answer is: To prevent the sexual cycle of the pathogen proceeding: This photo is of oospores; they are sexual spores of the oomycetes (water moulds). In some pathogens (such as P.infestans which causes late blight of potato or tomato) oospores will only form if there are   and  strains present. Many countries only have one of the two mating types , thus preventing sexual spores being produced. The incorrect answers were: It is good to keep the amount of pathogen low in whatever way you can; whilst this is true, the amount of additional pathogen arriving on imports would be miniscule relative to the established population. It will allow imports to be excluded so that local farmers can be supported; under WTO rules it is not easy to exclude produce except for phytosanitary reasons, but this is not the reason from a plant pathology viewpoint. The identification of the pathogen may not have been accurate and another pathogen may gain access to the country; this is unlikely as phytosanitary inspectors are well trained and are supported by expert scientists who test potential new pathogens found on imported material.

In nature, the bacteria are exclusively transmitted by insects from the Cicadellidae and Ceropidae families, which feed on plants xylem fluid. There are several species of insects in the UK which could act as vectors (agents of spread) of X. fastidiosa bacteria, including the common froghopper ( Philaenus spumarius ).

On grafted trees, infections are most frequently found in areas close to the graft where callusing occurs, whereas in orchard and coppiced trees infections usually occur at the base of the stem (collars or insertion points). Masses of pin-head sized, yellow-orange to reddish-brown pustules may also be evident on infected bark. These fruiting bodies erupt through lenticels (gas exchange structures) in the bark and exude long, yellow-orange tendrils/threads of spores in humid and wet weather. Another obvious symptom of this disease is wilted and brown dying and dead leaves which are retained by the tree above a girdling canker .

Comments on the other options: Fungal gummosis is common on citrus species and is associated with Phytophthora species (I know, its not a fungus  but no one calls this Oomycete or Fungus-like gummosis ). The gummosis is lower down on the trunk and accompanied by heavy staining below and dieback and decline in the crown.

       "  'explanation': 'The correct answer is: Smut fungus: This is leaf infection of maize by Ustilago maydis ( Mycosarcoma maydis ). Infection causing the black sooty spores on the cobs are a much more familiar sight. The incorrect answers were: Crown gall caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ; crown gall can produce galls of this size but the galls are never smooth they are usually brown and Agrobacterium does not infect grasses. Gall -forming insect; this is reasonable suggestion but (difficult to tell from the photo) the leaf is distorted and there are no galls there . Viral infection; the distortion seen here would not be so localised if it was caused by a virus .',\n",

       "  'explanation': 'The correct answer is: The decision as to what to do will depend on the crop and pest : Generally, it is appropriate to destroy the crop trash after harvest (ploughing or composting or burning), however there are times when it may be appropriate to remove it and store it.  If the pest is not mobile; the natural enemies are mobile and there is no threat from other pests or diseases, then this may be a sensible strategy. The incorrect answers were: Burn it or compost it as far as is practical; this is a safe option and is usually the correct one. Store the debris nearby to allow the natural enemies to emerge; this can be a good practice but should not be universally adopted unless you are aware of all the pests and diseases on the trash. Take it to a field where the same crop is being grown and spread it onto the soil; this is never appropriate and would completely undermine most of the benefits of crop rotation.',\n",

Separate the wispy dieback (fungal) around the crown periphery from the larger dead branches I associate with root disturbance and other abiotic factors. Described as stag-headed because they look like antlers. Comments on the other options: Air pollution is one of those fall-back options: when pest and disease options have been ostensibly eliminated look for something that could have a widespread impact on tree growth. Nutrient deficiencies is another fall-back option. Ive not included lightning damage. I said diagnosing tree health problems wasnt going to be easy ...',\n",
